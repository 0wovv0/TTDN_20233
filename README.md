#License Plate Detection and Recognition using YOLOv8

Overview

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for license plate detection and YOLOv8-OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) for character recognition. The system detects license plates from images or videos, recognizes characters, and overlays the detected text back onto the media.

Pipeline

License Plate Detection: YOLOv8 is used to detect license plates in images or video frames.

Character Recognition: YOLOv8-OBB is applied to extract and recognize characters within the detected license plates.

Result Overlay: The recognized license plate number is displayed directly on the processed image or video.
